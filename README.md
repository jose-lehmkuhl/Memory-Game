# Memory Game

This memory game is my final project on the Udacity Front-End Foundations Nanodegree Program.

## Download

The game can be downloaded from (https://github.com/ "this github link").

## Starting the game

To start it you just have to open the index.html file in your browser. Files path must be exactly how they were when downloaded(Ex: app.js should be in a "js" folder located in the same directory of the index.html).

## How to play

The objective is to get all cards facing up, you lock the cards by clicking in 2 matching cards in a row.
Here are extra considerations:

* Timer starts once you open the page or restart the game
* After 15 turns you loose your first star, and another one after the next 15 turns
* When you finished the game, your score and your time will be displayed. You can click "Restart" to play again or close it by pressing the "x" button.

## Dependencies

The game used Bootstrap and JQuery to run, files are included in the download.

## Final considerations

This project layout is inspired on Udacity Matching Game, wich can be found (https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game "here").
